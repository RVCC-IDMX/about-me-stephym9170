## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to be able to properly create a project site about ourselves using CSS and HTML. I learned different things within each section although some information may have overlapped. In the index file I learned how to write code in order to create the substance that I wanted to be on the site such as links, different sections, a nav bar, a footer, different headers and I even learned how to create a contact form. In the style.CSS file I learned how to write code in order to style the index with that being said I learned how to add color, add borders, how to space things, how to add padding, align items and text, and overall I learned how to just make things neater and more put together. Lastly, in the Nav.css file I learned how to style a Nav bar and I used features similar to the style.css but it was a whole separate file so I learned that they must be two separate files. With Css I learned that there are different media states in how to style each media state since one style doesn't necessarily work for all.
## Color Scheme
The color scheme I chose for this project was 2 different blues, a yellow, and a hint of white. I chose this color scheme because blue is my favorite color, and yellow goes very well with blue especially a goldish yellow. I added white because I wanted the Nav bar writing to be a different color from everthing else and I liked how the white looked on the light blue. The Hex codes for the 3 main colors are 87BFFF, 376BA6, and F2C068 in which the first two are the blues and the last one is the yellow.
