                listening to them both around the same time in about late 2016 
                early 2017 and even got to see Kehlani in concert back in 2018.</p>
            <p> I like pizza, tacos, smoothies, fruits, and I love pickles, 
                chocolate cake, and icecream.</p>
            <p> I like to play video games in which I play them practically

    <h2>CSS Animations</h2>

    
    <div>
    
    
        <p>CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one css style to another which basically means that transitions are able to be animated.
        Animations consist of 2 components: a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes(defined later) that indicate the start and end stages of the animation style as well as possible intermediate waypoints. </p>
        <p>Three key advantages to css animations:
        They’re easy to use for simple animations; you can create them without having to know JavaScript.
        The animations run well, even if the system you use is pretty slow or average. As stated by my source ”Since simple animations can perform poorly in JavaScript, the rendering engine can use frame skipping and other techniques to keep the performance as smooth as possible.”
        Letting the browser control the animation sequence lets the browser optimize performance and efficiency, which then means that the browser determines the effectiveness of the animation sequence.</p>
        <p>Steps of configuration:
        You style the element you want to animate with the animation property or sub properties. 
        Sub properties include 
        Name- specifies the name of the key frame at rule describing the animations keyframes
        Duration-configures the length of time that an animation should take to complete one cycle.(xs or Xms)
        Timing function- configures the timing of the animation; how the animation transitions through keyframes ( ease, ease-out, ease-in, ease-in-out, linear, cubic bezier)
        Delay- configures the delay between the time the element is loaded and the beginning of the animation sequence (same as duration)
        Iteration count- configures the number of times the animation should repeat (x)
        Direction- configures whether or not the animation should alternate direction on each run through the sequence (normal, alternate) 
        Fill mode- configures what values are applied by the animation before and after its executing (forward, backwards, both, none)
        Play state- lets you pause and resume the animation sequence
        Next are the key frames in which each describes how the animated element should render at a given time during the animation sequence. Keyframes use a percentage tag to indicate the time during the animation sequence at which they take place.(paused and running)</p>
        <p>Animate.style on GitHub states different animations and also shows how to install and use the different types of animations using npm, yarn, import and by adding it to your webpage. </p>
