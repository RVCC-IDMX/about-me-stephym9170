    <h2>An Excerpt from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>

    
    <div>
    
    <p>As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. “And now, Poole, let us get to ours,”
    he said; and taking the poker under his arm, 
    led the way into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now quite dark. 
    The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that
    deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about 
    their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where they 
    sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was 
    only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.</p>

    <p>“So it will walk all day, sir,” whispered Poole; “
    and the better part of the night. Only when a new sample 
    comes from the chemist, there’s a bit of a break. Ah, it’s an ill conscience 
    that’s such an enemy to rest! Ah, sir, there’s blood foully shed in 
    every step of it! But hark again, a little closer--put your heart in your
    ears, Mr. Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctor’s foot?”</p>

    <p>The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they
    went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of
    Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. “Is there never anything else?” 
    he asked.</p>

    <p>Poole nodded. “Once,” he said. “Once I heard it weeping!”</p>

    <p>“Weeping? how that?” said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of 
    horror.</p>

    <p>“Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,” said the butler. 
    “I came away with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.”</p>

    <p>But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe
    from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the 
    nearest table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with
    bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down,
    up and down, in the quiet of the night. “Jekyll,” cried Utterson, 
    with a loud voice, “I demand to see you.” He paused a moment, but 
    there came no reply. “I give you fair warning, our suspicions are 
    aroused, and I must and shall see you,” he resumed; “if not by fair
    means, then by foul--if not of your consent, then by brute force!”</p>

    <p>“Utterson,” said the voice, “for God’s sake, have mercy!”</p>

    <p>“Ah, that’s not Jekyll’s voice--it’s Hyde’s!” cried Utterson. 
    “Down with the door, Poole!”</p>

    <p>Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, 
    and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal 
    screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the 
    axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four 
    times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of 
    excellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock 
    burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.</p>
